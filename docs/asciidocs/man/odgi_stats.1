.SH "NAME"
odgi_stats \- metrics describing variation graphs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBodgi stats\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi stats(1) command produces statistics of a variation graph. Among other metrics, it can calculate the #nodes, #edges, #paths and the total nucleotide length of the graph. Various histogram summary options complement the tool. If [\fB\-B, \-\-bed\-multicov\fP=\fIBED\fP] is set, the metrics will be produced for the intervals specified in the BED.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Graph Files IO"
.sp
\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
File containing the succinct variation graph to create statistics from. The file name usually ends with \fI.og\fP.
.RE
.SS "Summary Options"
.sp
\fB\-S, \-\-summarize\fP
.RS 4
Summarize the graph properties and dimensions. Print to stdout the #nucleotides, #nodes, #edges and #paths of the graph.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-W, \-\-weak\-connected\-components\fP
.RS 4
Shows the properties of the weakly connected components.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-L, \-\-self\-loops\fP
.RS 4
Number of nodes with a self\-loop.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-N, \-\-nondeterministic\-edges\fP
.RS 4
Show nondeterministic edges (those that extend to the same next base).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b, \-\-base\-content\fP
.RS 4
Describe the base content of the graph. Print to stdout the #A, #C, #G and #T of the graph.
.RE
.SS "Sorting goodness evaluation"
.sp
\fB\-l, \-\-mean\-links\-length\fP
.RS 4
Calculate the mean links length. This metric is path\-guided and computable in 1D and 2D.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g, \-\-no\-gap\-links\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt penalize gap links in the mean links length. A gap link is a link which connects two nodes that are consecutive in the linear pangenomic order. This option is specifiable only to compute the mean links length in 1D.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-sum\-path\-nodes\-distances\fP
.RS 4
Calculate the sum of path nodes distances. This metric is path\-guided and computable in 1D and 2D. For each path, it iterates from node to node, summing their distances, and normalizing by the path length. In 1D, if a link goes back in the linearized viewpoint of the graph, this is penalized (adding 3 times its length in the sum).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d, \-\-penalize\-different\-orientation\fP
.RS 4
If a link connects two nodes which have different orientations, this is penalized (adding 2 times its length in the sum).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c, \-\-coords\-in\fP
.RS 4
File containing the layout coordinates of the succinct variation graph specified as input. The file name usually ends with \fI.lay\fP. When the layout coordinates are provided, the mean links length and the sum path nodes distances statistics are evaluated in 2D, else in 1D.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P, \-\-path\-statistics\fP
.RS 4
Display the statistics (mean links length or sum path nodes distances) for each path.
.RE
.SS "Threading"
.sp
\fB\-t, \-\-threads\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of threads to use.
.RE
.SS "Program Information"
.sp
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Print a help message for \fBodgi stats\fP.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
\fB0\fP
.RS 4
Success.
.RE
.sp
\fB1\fP
.RS 4
Failure (syntax or usage error; parameter error; file processing failure; unexpected error).
