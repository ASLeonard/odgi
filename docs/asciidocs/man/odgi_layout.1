.SH "NAME"
odgi_layout \- use SGD to make 2D layouts of the graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBodgi layout\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-o, \-\-out\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi layout(1) command draws 2D layouts of the graph using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The input graph must be sorted
and id\-compacted. The algorithm itself is described in \c
.URL "https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04626" "Graph Drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent" "."
The force\-directed graph drawing algorithm minimizes the graph\(cqs energy function or stress level.
It applies SGD to move a single pair of nodes at a time. The rendered graph is written in SVG format.
