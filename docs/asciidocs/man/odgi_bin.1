.SH "NAME"
odgi_bin \- binning of pangenome sequence and path information in the graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBodgi bin\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi bin(1) command bins a given variation graph. The pangenome sequence, the one\-time traversal of all nodes from smallest to
largest node identifier, can be summed up into bins of a specified size. For each bin, the path metainformation is summarized.
This enables a summarized view of gigabase scale graphs. Each step of a path is a bin and connected to its next bin via a link.
A link has a start bin identifier and an end bin identifier.
.br
The concept of odgi bin is also applied in odgi viz.
A demonstration of how the odgi bin JSON output can be used for an interactive visualization is realized in the \c
.URL "https://graph\-genome.github.io/" "Pantograph"
project. Per default, odgi bin writes the bins to stdout in a tab\-delimited format: \fBpath.name\fP, \fBpath.prefix\fP, \fBpath.suffix\fP,
\fBbin\fP (bin identifier), \fBmean.cov\fP (mean coverage of the path in this bin), \fBmean.inv\fP (mean inversion rate of this path in this bin),
\fBmean.pos\fP (mean nucleotide position of this path in this bin), \fBfirst.nucl\fP (first nucleotide position of this path in this bin),
\fBlast.nucl\fP (last nucleotide position of this path in this bin). These nucleotide ranges might span positions that are not present in the bin. Example:
A range of 1\-100 means that the first nucleotide has position 1 and the last has position 100, but nucleotide 45 could be located in
another bin. For an exact positional output, please specify [\fB\-j, \-\-json\fP].

File containing the succinct variation graph to investigate the bin from. The file name usually ends with \fI.og\fP.

Write the pangenome sequence to \fIFILE\fP in FASTA format.

.sp
\fB\-n, \-\-number\-bins\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
The number of bins the pangenome sequence should be chopped up to.

\fB\-w, \-\-bin\-width\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
The bin width specifies the size of each bin.
.RE

.RS 4
Annotate rows by prefix and suffix of this delimiter.
.RE

\fB\-a, \-\-aggregate\-delim\fP
.RS 4
Aggregate on path prefix delimiter. Argument depends on [\fB\-D, \-\-path\-delim\fP=\fISTRING\fP].

\fB\-j, \-\-json\fP
.RS 4
Print bins and links to stdout in pseudo JSON format. Each line is a valid JSON object, but the whole file is not a valid JSON!
First, each bin including its pangenome sequence is printed to stdout per line. Second, for each path in the graph, its
traversed bins including metainformation: \fBbin\fP (bin identifier), \fBmean.cov\fP (mean coverage of the path in this bin), \fBmean.inv\fP (mean inversion rate of this path in this bin),
\fBmean.pos\fP (mean nucleotide position of this path in this bin), and an array of ranges determining the nucleotide position
of the path in this bin. Switching first and last nucleotide in a range represents a complement reverse
orientation of that particular sequence.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-no\-seqs\fP
.RS 4
If [\fB\-j, \-\-json\fP] is set, no nucleotide sequences will be printed to stdout in order to save disk space.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g, \-\-no\-gap\-links\fP
.RS 4
Links connecting a path from left to right may not be relevant to understand a path\(cqs traversal through the bins. They
can be left out saving disk space.
