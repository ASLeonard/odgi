== DESCRIPTION

*odgi*, the *Optimized Dynamic (genome) Graph Interface*, links
a thrifty dynamic in-memory variation graph data model to a set of algorithms designed for scalable sorting, pruning,
transformation, and visualization of very large genome graphs. *odgi* includes https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgipy.html[python bindings]
that can be used to
https://odgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/tutorial.html[directly
interface with its data model]. This *odgi* manual provides detailed information about its features and subcommands, including examples.

== COMMANDS

Each command has its own man page which can be viewed using e.g. *man odgi_build.1*. Below we have a brief summary of syntax and subcommand description.

*odgi build* [*-g, --gfa*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi build(1) command constructs a succinct variation graph from a GFA. Currently, only GFA1 is supported. For details of the format please see https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md.

*odgi stats* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi stats(1) command produces statistics of a variation graph. Among other metrics, it can calculate the #nodes, #edges, #paths and the total nucleotide length of the graph. Various histogram summary options complement the tool. If [*-B, --bed-multicov*=_BED_] is set, the metrics will be produced for the intervals specified in the BED.

*odgi sort* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi sort(1) command sorts a succinct variation graph. Odgi sort offers a diverse palette of sorting algorithms to
determine the node order:

 - A topological sort: A graph can be sorted via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first search (BFS)] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[depth-first search (DFS)]. Optionally,
   a chunk size specifies how much of the graph to grab at once in each topological sorting phase. The sorting algorithm will continue the sort from the
   next node in the prior graph order that has not been sorted, yet. The cycle breaking algorithm applies a DFS sort until
   a cycle is found. We break and start a new DFS sort phase from where we stopped.
 - A random sort: The graph is randomly sorted. The node order is randomly shuffled from http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mt19937/[Mersenne Twister pseudo-random] generated numbers.
 - A sparse matrix mondriaan sort: We can partition a hypergraph with integer weights and uniform hyperedge costs using the http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~bisse101/Mondriaan/[Mondriaan] partitioner.
 - A 1D linear SGD sort: Odgi implements a 1D linear, variation graph adjusted, multi-threaded version of the https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04626[Graph Drawing
   by Stochastic Gradient Descent] algorithm. The force-directed graph drawing algorithm minimizes the graph's energy function
   or stress level. It applies stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to move a single pair of nodes at a time.
 - An eades algorithmic sort: Use http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~pead6616/old_spring_paper.pdf[Peter Eades' heuristic for graph drawing].

Sorting the paths in a graph my refine the sorting process. For the users' convenience, it is possible to specify a whole
pipeline of sorts within one parameter.

*odgi view* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi view(1) command can convert a graph in odgi format to GFAv1. It can reveal a graph's internal structures for e.g. debugging processes.

*odgi kmers* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-c, --stdout*] [_OPTION_]... +
Given a kmer length, the odgi kmers(1) command can emit all kmers. The output can be refined by setting the maximum number
of furcations at edges or by not considering nodes above a given node degree limit.

*odgi unitig* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi unitig(1) command can print all unitigs of a given odgi graph to standard output in FASTA format. Unitigs can also be emitted
in a fixed sequence quality FASTQ format. Various parameters can refine the unitigs to print.

*odgi viz* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi viz(1) command can produce a linear, static visualization of an odgi variation graph. It aggregates the pangenome into bins
and directly renders a raster image. The binning level depends on the target width of the PNG to emit. Can be used to produce visualizations for gigabase scale pangenomes. For more information
about the binning process, please refer to <<odgi_bin.adoc#_odgi_bin1, odgi bin>>. If reverse coloring was selected, only
the bins with a reverse rate of at least 0.5 are colored. Currently, there is no parameter to color according to the
sequence coverage in bins available.

*odgi paths* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi paths(1) command allows the investigation of paths of a given variation graph. It can calculate overlap statistics
of groupings of paths.

*odgi prune* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi prune(1) command can remove complex parts of a graph. One can drop paths, nodes by a certain kind of edge coverage,
edges and graph tips. Specifying a kmer length and a maximum number of furcations, the graph can be broken at edges not
fitting into these conditions.

*odgi unchop* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi unchop(1) command merges each unitig into a single node.

*odgi normalize* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
The odgi normalize(1) command <<odgi_unchop.adoc#_odgi_unchop1, unchops>> a given variation graph and simplifies redundant furcations.

*odgi subset* [*-i, --idx*=_FILE_] [*-o, --out*=_FILE_] [_OPTION_]... +
Extracting a node subset of a variation graph is the task of the odgi subset(1) command. Users can specify a node, a list of nodes
or a the context of which to generate a subset from.
