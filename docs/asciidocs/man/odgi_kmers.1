.SH "NAME"
odgi_kmers \- show and characterize the kmer space of the graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBodgi kmers\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-c, \-\-stdout\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Given a kmer length, the odgi kmers(1) command can emit all kmers. The output can be refined by setting the maximum number
of furcations at edges or by not considering nodes above a given node degree limit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Graph Files IO"
.sp
\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
