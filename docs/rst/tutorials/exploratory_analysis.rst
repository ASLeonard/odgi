Exploratory analysis
####################

1) Download the GFA from here (an human burned graph)...
2) odgi build
3) odgi viz default + little explanation + link to full odgi viz doc
4) Inversions (-z/--color-by-mean-inversion-rate)
5) NOT SURE) Repetitive regions (binned mode with -m/--color-by-mean-coverage): regions with repetitive sequences will present coverage peaks
6) Linearity (gradient mode with  -d/--change-darkness): short links at the bottom and a smooth color gradient indicate a linear, and well-sorted, graph. We would need to explain the sorting.
7) Completeness of haplotypes (-M/--prefix-merges): we use it to see how complete is the burned graph.
