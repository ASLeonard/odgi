.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBodgi stats\fP [\fB\-i, –idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]…
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The odgi stats(1) command produces statistics of a variation graph.
Among other metrics, it can calculate the #nodes, #edges, #paths and the
total nucleotide length of the graph. Various histogram summary options
complement the tool. If [\fB\-B, –bed\-multicov\fP=\fIBED\fP] is set, the
metrics will be produced for the intervals specified in the BED.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Graph Files IO
.nf
\fB\-i, –idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP
File containing the succinct variation graph to create statistics
from. The file name usually ends with \fI\&.og\fP\&.
.fi
.sp
.SS Summary Options
.nf
\fB\-S, –summarize\fP
Summarize the graph properties and dimensions. Print to stdout the
#nucleotides, #nodes, #edges and #paths of the graph.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-W, –weak\-connected\-components\fP
Shows the properties of the weakly connected components.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-L, –self\-loops\fP
Number of nodes with a self\-loop.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-N, –nondeterministic\-edges\fP
Show nondeterministic edges (those that extend to the same next base).
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-b, –base\-content\fP
Describe the base content of the graph. Print to stdout the #A, #C, #G
and #T of the graph.
.fi
.sp
.SS Sorting goodness evaluation
.nf
\fB\-l, –mean\-links\-length\fP
Calculate the mean links length. This metric is path\-guided and
computable in 1D and 2D.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-g, –no\-gap\-links\fP
Don’t penalize gap links in the mean links length. A gap link is a
link which connects two nodes that are consecutive in the linear
pangenomic order. This option is specifiable only to compute the mean
links length in 1D.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-s, –sum\-path\-nodes\-distances\fP
Calculate the sum of path nodes distances. This metric is path\-guided
and computable in 1D and 2D. For each path, it iterates from node to
node, summing their distances, and normalizing by the path length. In
1D, if a link goes back in the linearized viewpoint of the graph, this
is penalized (adding 3 times its length in the sum).
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-d, –penalize\-different\-orientation\fP
If a link connects two nodes which have different orientations, this
is penalized (adding 2 times its length in the sum).
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-c, –coords\-in\fP
File containing the layout coordinates of the succinct variation graph
specified as input. The file name usually ends with \fI\&.lay\fP\&. When the
layout coordinates are provided, the mean links length and the sum
path nodes distances statistics are evaluated in 2D, else in 1D.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB\-P, –path\-statistics\fP
Display the statistics (mean links length or sum path nodes distances)
for each path.
.fi
.sp
.SS Threading
.nf
\fB\-t, –threads\fP=\fIN\fP
Number of threads to use.
.fi
.sp
.SS Program Information
.nf
\fB\-h, –help\fP
Print a help message for \fBodgi stats\fP\&.
.fi
.sp
.SH EXIT STATUS
.nf
\fB0\fP
Success.
.fi
.sp
.nf
\fB1\fP
Failure (syntax or usage error; parameter error; file processing
failure; unexpected error).
.fi
.sp
.SH BUGS
.sp

\fI\%https://github.com/pangenome/odgi/issues\fP\&.
