.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Odgi is a set of of tools that manipulate variation graphs. TODO Explain data structure. TODO Link to vg paper. TODO Link to handle graph paper. TODO Explain purpose. TODO Give summary of the capabilities of the set of tools.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
Each command has its own man page which can be viewed using e.g. \fBman odgi_build.1\fP. Below we have a brief summary of syntax and sub\-command description.
.sp
\fBodgi build\fP [\fB\-g, \-\-gfa\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-o, \-\-out\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
The odgi build(1) command constructs a succinct variation graph from a GFA. Currently, only GFA1 is supported. For details of the format please see \c
.URL "https://github.com/GFA\-spec/GFA\-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md" "" "."
\fBodgi stats\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
The odgi stats(1) command produces statistics of a variation graph. Among other metrics, it can calculate the #nodes, #edges, #paths and the total nucleotide length of the graph. Various histogram summary options complement the tool. If [\fB\-B, \-\-bed\-multicov\fP=\fIBED\fP] is set, the metrics will be produced for the intervals specified in the BED.
