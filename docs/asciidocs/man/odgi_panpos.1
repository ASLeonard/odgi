odgi_panpos \- get the pangenome position of a given path and nucleotide position (1\-based)

\fBodgi panpos\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-p, \-\-path\fP=\fISTRING\fP] [\fB\-n, \-\-nuc\-pos\fP=\fIN\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi panpos(1) command give a pangenome position for a given path and nucleotide position. It requires a path index,
which can be created with odgi pathindex. Going from \fBpath:position\fP \(-> \fBpangenome:position\fP is important when
navigating large graphs in an interactive manner like in the \c

project. All
input and output positions are 1\-based.
