.SH "NAME"
odgi_server \- start a HTTP server with a given index file to query a pangenome position
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBodgi server\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-p, \-\-port\fP=\fIN\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi server(1) command starts an HTTP server with a given path index as input. The idea is that we can go from
\fBpath:position\fP \(-> \fBpangenome:position\fP via GET requests to the HTTP server. The server headers do not block cross origin requests.
Example GET request: \fB\c
.URL "http://localost:3000/path_name/nucleotide_position" "" "\fP."
.br
The required path index can be created with odgi pathindex. Going from \fBpath:position\fP \(-> \fBpangenome:position\fP is important when
navigating large graphs in an interactive manner like in the \c
.URL "https://graph\-genome.github.io/" "Pantograph" " "
project. All
input and output positions are 1\-based. If no IP address is specified, the server will run on localhost.
