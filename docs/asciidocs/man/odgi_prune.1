.SH "NAME"
odgi_prune \- remove complex parts of the graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBodgi prune\fP [\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fB\-o, \-\-out\fP=\fIFILE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The odgi prune(1) command can remove complex parts of a graph. One can drop paths, nodes by a certain kind of edge coverage,
edges and graph tips. Specifying a kmer length and a maximum number of furcations, the graph can be broken at edges not
fitting into these conditions.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Graph Files IO"
.sp
\fB\-i, \-\-idx\fP=\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
File containing the succinct variation graph to load in. The file name usually ends with \fI.og\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-out\fP=\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Write the pruned graph to \fIFILE\fP. The file name should end with \fI.og\fP.
.RE
.SS "Kmer Options"
.sp
\fB\-k, \-\-kmer\-length\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
The length of the kmers to consider.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e, \-\-max\-furcations\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Break at edges that would induce \fIN\fP many furcations in a kmer.
.RE
.SS "Node Options"
.sp
\fB\-d, \-\-max\-degree\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Remove nodes that have a higher node degree than \fIN\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c, \-\-min\-coverage\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Remove nodese covered by fewer than \fIN\fP number of path steps.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C, \-\-max\-coverage\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Remove nodes covered by more than \fIN\fP number of path steps.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T, \-\-cut\-tips\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Remove nodes which are graph tips.
.RE
.SS "Edge Options"
.sp
\fB\-E, \-\-edge\-coverage\fP
.RS 4
Remove edges outside of the minimum and maximum coverage rather than nodes. Only set this argument in combination with
[\fB\-c, \-\-min\-coverage\fP=\fIN\fP] and [\fB\-C, \-\-max\-coverage\fP=\fIN\fP].
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b, \-\-best\-edges\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Only keep the \fIN\fP most covered inbound and output edges of each node.
.RE
.SS "Path Options"
.sp
\fB\-D, \-\-drop\-paths\fP
.RS 4
Remove the paths from the graph.
.RE
.SS "Threading"
.sp
\fB\-t, \-\-threads\fP=\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of threads to use.
.RE
.SS "Program Information"
.sp
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Print a help message for \fBodgi prune\fP.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
\fB0\fP
.RS 4
Success.
.RE
.sp
\fB1\fP
.RS 4
Failure (syntax or usage error; parameter error; file processing failure; unexpected error).
